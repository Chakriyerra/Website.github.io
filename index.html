                    <li>Plant diseases are a significant concern for gardeners,
                        farmers, and plant enthusiasts worldwide. Just like
                        humans and animals, plants can be affected by various diseases
                        that impact their growth, productivity, and overall health.
                        These diseases can result from pathogs such as bacteria, fungi,
                        viruses, and nematodes, which attack plants in different ways.

                    <li>Chemical Control: Apply fungicides, bactericides, or other chemicals to control pathogens.</li>
                    <li>Biological Control: Use natural predators or beneficial microorganisms to manage diseases.</li>
                    <li>Resistant Varieties: Plant disease-resistant crops to prevent infections.</li>
                    <li>Sanitation: Remove infected plant material and sterilize tools to reduce pathogen spread.</li>
                    <li>Fallow Periods: Allow soil to rest or use solarization to kill pathogens.</li>
                    <li>Proper Irrigation Management: Use drip irrigation and avoid overhead watering to reduce disease spread.</li>
                    <li>Physical Barriers: Install row covers and use mulch to protect plants.</li>
                    <li>Pruning and Thinning: Remove diseased parts and thin plants to improve airflow.</li>
                    <li>Integrated Disease Management (IDM): Combine various control techniques for effective disease management.</li>
